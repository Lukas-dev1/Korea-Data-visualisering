# Korea Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook (`Korea.ipynb`) contains an analysis of income data based on education levels in Korea. The notebook is written in Python and utilizes various data science libraries to preprocess the data and create visualizations.

## Overview

The notebook includes the following key steps:

1. **Library Imports**: Essential libraries for data processing and visualization are imported, including:
    - `matplotlib`
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `plotly`
    - `seaborn`
    - `scipy`
    
2. **Data Preparation**: 
    - The dataset's education levels are mapped to more descriptive labels (e.g., "No education", "Elementary", "Middle school", etc.).
    - Data is grouped and summarized by education levels.

3. **Data Visualization**:
    - A pie chart is created to represent the distribution of income across different education levels.

## How to Run

To run this notebook, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas plotly seaborn scipy
```

After setting up the environment, you can run the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook Korea.ipynb
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
